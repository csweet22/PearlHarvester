# 6 Day Disclaimer
Majority of the code was written in 6 days due to the nature of this being a Game Jam game ([LoJam x GDS 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gds-x-lojam-2025/rate/3397558)) and could be done better, but given the circumstances I think it generally is a pretty solid foundation.

# Brief
Created in 6 days for [LoJam x GDS 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gds-x-lojam-2025/rate/3397558) with the "Break the System" theme. While we were the main organizers for the event, we made this game in the spirit of the jam!

* Explore the insides of a massive creature, solve gut-wrenching puzzles, and harvest Pearls with your trusty axe.
* Use Pearls to buy axe upgrades at Terminals.
* Avoid periodically rising blood.

# Goals

Optionally, collect all 18 Pearls.
Optionally, try to get the fastest time to reach the quota with the speedrun timer in the 'Settings Menu.'
